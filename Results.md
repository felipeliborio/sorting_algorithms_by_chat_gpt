# Results

## Introduction

The following algorithms were selected for this experiment: Mergesort, Quicksort, Radixsort, Timsort, and Pattern defeating quicksort.

They were chosen for a mix of their popularity, relevance, and performance.

They were implemented by chatGPT in the following languages: Rust, Java and Typescript (with Node.js).

These languages where chosen for a plethora of reasons. Including popularity, performance, and the fact that they consist in one VM language (i.e. Java), one interpreted language (i.e. Typescript, even though it is compiled to another interpreted language) and one compiled systems language (i.e. Rust).

## Methods

### Mergesort
A propular stable algorithm that sorts by comparison.

### Quicksort
Anohter popular comparison sort algorithm that can be implemented to be generaly faster than the mergesort, we asked for an unstable and a stable version of it.

### Radixsort
A non-comparison sort algorithm that sorts by distribution and can perform very well on certain types of keys, expected to be faster than the other algorithms on the test data.

### Timsort
One of the fastest stable comparison sort algorithms, it is used as default stable sorting algorithm in many languages, including Java and Python.

### Pattern defeating quicksort
One of the fastest unstable comparison sort algorithms, it is used as default unstable sorting algorithm in languages such as Rust and Go.

### About the instances
For this experiment we created two test instances composed of positive 32 bit integers, one with 100000 elements and one with 5000000 elements.

They were generated by a Rust program which is available in this repository.

### About the system used to run the implementations
The tests were run on a computer with the following specs:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- 32GB of 3600Mhz DDR4 RAM with the following timings:
 - tCL: 16 tRCDRD: 18 tRCDRD: 18 tRP: 20 rTAS: 38 CR: 1T tRFC: 484
- Ryzen 5900X CPU

The Java version used was the JDK 20, the Node.js version used was 19.7.0 with TypeScript 4.9.5 and Rust 1.68.1.

## Results
Each implementation was run 10 times, average time and correctness were evaluated. The algorithms generated by chatGPT were also compared to default sorting algorithms in the languages they were implemented in, this information is at the baseline column of each table. For Rust, as its standard library contains both an stable and an unstable sorting algorithm, both are used appropriately as the baseline.

### Mergesort
**100000 elements**
| Language   | Average time (seconds) | Correct     | Baseline (seconds) |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Java       | 0.011                  | true        | 0.0279             |
| Rust       | 0.00668                | true        | 0.003405           |
| Typescript | 0.0221                 | true        | 0.0171             |

**5000000 elements**
| Language   | Average time (seconds) | Correct     | Baseline (seconds) |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Java       | 0.5137                 | true        | 0.3364             |
| Rust       | 0.441                  | true        | 0.2205             |
| Typescript | 1.3531                 | true        | 1.1126             |

For Mergesort, all implementations were able to correctly sort the test instances. The Rust implementation was the fastest, followed by the Java implementation and the Typescript implementation which was over twice as slow than its counterparts.

### Quicksort Stable
**100000 elements**
| Language   | Average time (seconds) | Correct     | Baseline (seconds) |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Java       | 0.0508                 | true        | 0.0279             |
| Rust       | 0.0047606              | false       | 0.003405           |
| Typescript | DNC                    | DNC         | 0.0171             |

**5000000 elements**
| Language   | Average time (seconds) | Correct     | Baseline (seconds) |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Java       | 1.2877                 | true        | 0.3364             |
| Rust       | 0.24678                | false       | 0.2205             |
| Typescript | DNC                    | DNC         | 1.1126             |

For the java implementation was the only correct one, although it was up to 4x as slow than Java's baseline. The Rust implementation did not sort the instances correctly, the the elements did keep their original order in this implementation,  and the Typescript implementation did not compile.

| Typescript | 0.7791                 | false       | 1.1126             |

For the pattern defeating quicksort, none of the implementations was able to correctly sort the test instances and only the Typescript implementation was able to run.
